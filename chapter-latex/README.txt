The reviewer wanted E1 omitted.
I have omitted it.
That means the paper now covers 3 experiments. Here is the mapping from the 5 experiments  that we actually did over the course of this work, and the re-submission experiment numbering:
 original   -> submitted                                            -> resubmission
====================================================================================
 1 of 5     -> a pilot, referred to as Green and van Deemter (2011) -> referred to as Green and van Deemter (2011)
 2 of 5     -> Experiment 1                                         -> ? maybe call it a pilot for this series ?
 3 of 5     -> Experiment 2                                         -> Experiment 1
 4 of 5     -> Experiment 3                                         -> Experiment 2
 5 of 5     -> Experiment 4                                         -> Experiment 3
