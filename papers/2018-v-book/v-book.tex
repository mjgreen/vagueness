\chapter{The Elusive Benefits of Vagueness: Evidence from Experiments}
\label{intro} % Always give a unique label
% use \chaptermark{}
% to alter or adjust the chapter heading in the running head

Much of everyday language is vague, even in situations where vagueness could have been
avoided (i.e., where vagueness is used â€œstrategically"). Yet the benefits of vagueness for
hearers and readers are proving to be elusive. We discuss a range of earlier controlled
experiments with human participants, and we report on a new series of experiments that
we conducted in recent years. These experiments, which focus on vague expressions that
are part of referential noun phrases, aim to separate the utility of vagueness (as defined by
the existence of borderline cases) from the utility of other factors that tend to co-occur
with vagueness. Having presented the evidence, we argue that the evidence supports a view
where the benefits that vague terms exert are due to other influences, and not to vagueness
itself.
