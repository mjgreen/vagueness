This repository contains, for each experiment: a plain text file containing the raw data for each participant; html files created from Rmarkdown scripts that show the R code for each step of the analysis together with the output of that R code in the form of tables of regression coefficients, and plots; the octave/psychtoolbox code that we ran to present the stimuli and collect responses. Here are links to those files:
