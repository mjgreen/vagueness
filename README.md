This repository contains, for each experiment: a plain text file containing the raw data for each participant; html files created from Rmarkdown scripts that show the R code for each step of the analysis together with the output of that R code in the form of tables of regression coefficients, and plots; the octave/psychtoolbox code that we ran to present the stimuli and collect responses. 

Cloning the repo gives you all the files needed to completely reproduce the experiments, but here are links to data, the output of analysis, and the main part of the octave code in case that is more convenient.
