Stuff to check for the resubmitted version:

\begin{itemize}
\item Now that the former Experiment 1 has been excised, it's important to check that all references to experiment numbers match the 3-experiment numbering instead of the old 4-experiment numbering.
\item We need a reference to \citet{green2013utility} to compensate for dropping e1.
\end{itemize}
